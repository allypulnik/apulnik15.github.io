        <p class="overview-1">This Project was created as a part of an Interactive Design studio at Texas A&M University.<br>Team: Ally Pulnik & Natalya Abrahamian & Gracie Janse<br>I focused on Market Research and the Tablet Interface Design.</p>
        <p class="overview-2">AmbiCare is an application that facilitates aging in place by monitoring patient activity<br>and vitals in order to automate actions within their home, establish a link between patient and caregiver, and provide data visualizations of the aging patient directly to the caregiver. It will<br>alert the caregiver if the patient is in immediate danger and will monitor daily activities that<br>become more of a challenge with aging.</p>
        <p class="overview-3">The deliverables for this project included a web Interface for the care giver, a tablet interface for the care receiver, as well as a apple watch application for the care receiver.</p>

            <p class="project-takeaways-paragraph1">What We Learned
                Designing for the elderly user requires compassion and strong attention to detail. We had to change our design perspective to accommodate for their needs, in terms of color, size, motion, and functionality.
                We learned the importance of the role of the caregiver, and what specific aspects of elderly care they struggle with the most.</p>
            <p class="project-takeaways-paragraph2">Opportunities For Growth
                Increased accessibility features and settings
                Accommodations for Alzheimer's care
                Support for devices like blood sugar monitors</p>
            <p class="project-takeaways-paragraph3">Takeaways
                We’ve received so much feedback from friends and family expressing how much they want and need a product like this. People have told us that they wish they could use our product right now, or how they wish they could’ve had this product for a family member.
                As a group we’ve become more compassionate through designs, and this project has shown us that the end user is ultimately always the highest priority.</p>
